### Inspriation of my meme
1. This meme shows my 3 years study about compsci in UoA
    - The first year is very fun! We did a lot of interesting programs with Python which is chilllll ðŸ™Œ
    - The second year became a little hard than previous year, java synatx is difficult than python ðŸ˜±
    - Now I am in third year, these courses really freak me out! ðŸ˜­
2. I really like the character "Guoba" from genshin, So I decided Let him express my feelings in this meme'
3. I add the noise effect and let the color of the text be red in third row to show my panic and irritable feelings.
